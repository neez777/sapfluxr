wood_property:
  thermal_diffusivity: 0.00145    # cm²/s, will be estimated from density and moisture
  thermal_conductivity: 0.22   # W/(m·K), will be estimated if null
  volumetric_heat_capacity: 963700  # J/(m³·K), will be estimated if null
  dry_density: 450            # kg/m³, typical for pine
  basic_density: 380          # kg/m³, oven-dry mass / green volume
  moisture_content: 35        # %, softwoods often higher moisture content
  species: Pinus spp.         # species identification
  wood_type: softwood         # softwood classification
  temperature: 15             # °C, often cooler climates
  comments: Typical values for Pine species - may vary significantly by species and site

# Tree-specific measurements (optional - can override per tree in R)
tree_measurements:
  dbh: null                   # cm, diameter at breast height
  bark_thickness: null        # cm, bark thickness
  sapwood_depth: null         # cm, sapwood depth (often wider in pine)
  sapwood_area: null          # cm², conducting sapwood area
  heartwood_radius: null      # cm, heartwood radius

# Quality thresholds (species-specific defaults, can override in R)
quality_thresholds:
  max_velocity_cm_hr: 180     # cm/hr, upper bound for pine species
  min_velocity_cm_hr: -50     # cm/hr, lower bound (allows reverse flow)
  temperature_range: [-15, 45]  # °C, cooler climate species, wider range
