wood_property:
  thermal_diffusivity: 0.00143    # cm²/s, will be estimated from density and moisture
  thermal_conductivity: 0.27   # W/(m·K), will be estimated if null
  volumetric_heat_capacity: 1886000  # J/(m³·K), will be estimated if null
  dry_density: 550            # kg/m³, eucalyptus is denser than typical softwood
  fresh_density: 480          # kg/m³, fresh (green) wood density at field moisture
  moisture_content: 25        # %, often lower than conifers
  species: Eucalyptus spp.    # species identification
  wood_type: hardwood         # hardwood classification
  temperature: 25             # °C, often warmer climates
  comments: Typical values for Eucalyptus species - adjust for specific species/site conditions

# Tree-specific measurements (optional - can override per tree in R)
tree_measurements:
  dbh: null                   # cm, diameter at breast height
  bark_thickness: null        # cm, bark thickness (often thicker in eucalyptus)
  sapwood_depth: null         # cm, sapwood depth
  sapwood_area: null          # cm², conducting sapwood area
  heartwood_radius: null      # cm, heartwood radius

# Quality thresholds (species-specific defaults, can override in R)
quality_thresholds:
  max_velocity_cm_hr: 150     # cm/hr, eucalyptus often lower max than softwoods
  min_velocity_cm_hr: -50     # cm/hr, lower bound (allows reverse flow)
  temperature_range: [0, 50]  # °C, warmer climate species
