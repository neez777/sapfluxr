# Spacing Correction (Zero-Flow)

Probe misalignment causes a zero-flow offset. We correct this by identifying zero-flow periods.

## Method A: Stable VPD (Recommended)
Uses environmental data to find stable pre-dawn periods.

```r
# 1. Detect stable periods
vpd_pts <- detect_stable_vpd_periods(weather, vpd_threshold = 0.1)

# 2. Apply correction
vh_sc <- apply_spacing_correction(vh_raw, method = "vpd", weather_data = weather)
```

## Method B: Heartwood Reference
If the inner sensor is in heartwood (non-conducting), it acts as a continuous zero reference.

```r
vh_sc <- apply_heartwood_reference_correction(vh_raw)
```

# Wound Correction

Wounding causes flow to bypass the sensor, leading to underestimation. The effect increases over time.

## Temporal Tracking
`sapfluxr` models wound expansion linearly from installation to removal.

```r
wood <- load_wood_properties("eucalyptus")
wood$wound_correction$initial_diameter_mm <- 2.6 # Drill bit + immediate trauma
wood$wound_correction$final_diameter_mm <- 4.5   # Measured at end

vh_wc <- apply_wound_correction(vh_sc, wood_properties = wood)
```
