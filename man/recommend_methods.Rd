\usage{
recommend_methods(sap_data, probe_config, quality_assessment)
}
\arguments{
\item{sap_data}{Sap flow data object}

\item{probe_config}{Probe configuration object}

\item{quality_assessment}{Quality assessment results}
}
\value{
List containing recommended methods, parameters, and rationale
}
\description{
Provides intelligent method recommendations based on probe configuration,
data quality assessment, and flow conditions. Works with the existing
method compatibility system.
}
\details{
Recommendation logic:
\itemize{
\item High quality data: Use most accurate methods (HRM, DMA, MHR)
\item Medium quality: Use robust methods (DMA, HRM)
\item Low quality: Use simple, robust methods (MHR, Tmax)
\item Configuration compatibility always respected
}
