\title{Apply Wound Correction to Heat Pulse Velocity Data}
\usage{
apply_wound_correction(
  vh_data,
  wound_diameter = NULL,
  probe_spacing = "5mm",
  wood_properties = NULL,
  use_spacing_corrected = TRUE,
  confirm_parameters = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vh_data}{Data frame containing velocity measurements. Must have columns:
\describe{
\item{datetime}{POSIXct timestamp}
\item{Vh_cm_hr}{Heat pulse velocity (cm/hr) - raw or after spacing correction}
\item{method}{Calculation method used}
\item{sensor_position}{"inner" or "outer"}
}
If spacing correction was applied, should also have \code{Vh_cm_hr_sc} column.}

\item{wound_diameter}{Wound diameter in cm (typically 0.17-0.30 cm, i.e., 1.7-3.0 mm).
This is usually the drill bit diameter used for probe installation.
If NULL, attempts to read from wood_properties. Default: NULL}

\item{probe_spacing}{Probe spacing: "5mm" (standard, default) or "6mm" (legacy).
Determines which coefficient lookup table to use.}

\item{wood_properties}{Optional WoodProperties object or path to YAML file.
If provided and wound_diameter is NULL, will attempt to read wound_diameter
from the configuration.}

\item{use_spacing_corrected}{Logical. If TRUE and \code{Vh_cm_hr_sc} column exists,
applies wound correction to spacing-corrected velocities. Default: TRUE}

\item{confirm_parameters}{Logical. If TRUE and in interactive mode, prompts user
to confirm parameters before applying correction. Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
Data frame with original columns plus:
\describe{
\item{Vc_cm_hr}{Wound-corrected velocity (cm/hr)}
\item{wound_correction_factor}{Linear correction factor B applied}
\item{wound_diameter_cm}{Wound diameter used for correction}
}
}
\description{
Corrects heat pulse velocity measurements for the systematic underestimation
caused by wound tissue around probe insertion holes. Uses linear correction
coefficients from Burgess et al. (2001) lookup tables.
}
\details{
\strong{Why Wound Correction is Needed:}

When probes are inserted into sapwood, they create wound tissue that:
\itemize{
\item Has different thermal properties than healthy sapwood
\item Causes systematic underestimation of sap velocity
\item Effect increases with wound size and flow rate
}

\strong{Correction Method:}

Uses linear approximation: \code{Vc = B × Vh}

Where B is the correction factor from lookup tables (r² > 0.998).
B typically ranges from ~1.7 (small wounds) to ~2.6 (large wounds).

\strong{Wound Diameter:}

The wound diameter depends on drill bit size:
\itemize{
\item 1.7 mm drill → 0.17 cm wound diameter
\item 2.0 mm drill → 0.20 cm wound diameter (common for ICT probes)
\item 2.5 mm drill → 0.25 cm wound diameter
\item 3.0 mm drill → 0.30 cm wound diameter
}

\strong{Workflow Position:}

Wound correction should be applied AFTER spacing correction but BEFORE
flux density calculation:

\code{Vh (raw) → Spacing Correction → Wound Correction → Vc → Flux Density}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After spacing correction
vh_sc <- apply_spacing_correction(vh_results, ...)

# Apply wound correction with 2.0 mm drill bit
vh_corrected <- apply_wound_correction(
  vh_sc,
  wound_diameter = 0.20
)

# Or read wound diameter from wood properties
vh_corrected <- apply_wound_correction(
  vh_sc,
  wood_properties = "eucalyptus"
)

# Check correction factor applied
unique(vh_corrected$wound_correction_factor)
}
