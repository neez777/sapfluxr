\title{Detect Rate of Change Outliers (C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
detect_rate_of_change_outliers_cpp(vh_values, max_change = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{vh_values}{Numeric vector of Vh values (must be sorted by time)}

\item{max_change}{Numeric, maximum allowed change between consecutive points (cm/hr)}
}
\value{
Integer vector of outlier indices (1-based, returns the second point in each pair)
}
\description{
Fast C++ implementation of rate of change outlier detection.
Identifies consecutive measurements that change by more than the specified threshold.
}
\details{
Sap flow typically changes gradually. Large jumps (e.g., > 4 cm/hr between
30-min intervals) are likely sensor errors or logging issues.

\strong{Performance:} O(n) with fast C++ loops.
Typically 20-100x faster than pure R implementation.
