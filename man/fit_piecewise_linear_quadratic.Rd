\title{Fit Piecewise Linear-Quadratic Model}
\usage{
fit_piecewise_linear_quadratic(
  merged_data,
  breakpoint,
  primary_method,
  secondary_method
)
}
\arguments{
\item{merged_data}{Data frame with Vh_cm_hr_primary and Vh_cm_hr_secondary}

\item{breakpoint}{Breakpoint location (cm/hr)}

\item{primary_method}{Primary method name}

\item{secondary_method}{Secondary method name}
}
\value{
List with model results
}
\description{
Fits a model where the first segment is linear and the second segment
is quadratic. This is useful when the relationship curves after the breakpoint.
