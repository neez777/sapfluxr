\title{Detect Outliers Using Rolling Mean (C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
detect_outliers_rolling_mean_cpp(vh_values, window = 5L, threshold = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{vh_values}{Numeric vector of Vh values}

\item{window}{Integer, half-width of rolling window (default: 5, meaning 11-point window)}

\item{threshold}{Numeric, standard deviation multiplier (default: 3 = 99.7\% confidence)}
}
\value{
Integer vector of outlier indices (1-based for R compatibility)
}
\description{
Fast C++ implementation of rolling mean outlier detection.
Identifies points that deviate significantly from their local rolling mean.
}
\details{
For each point i, calculates mean and SD of window \link{(i-window):(i+window)}.
Points deviating by more than threshold × SD from the local mean are flagged.

\strong{Performance:} O(n × window) but with fast C++ loops and minimal overhead.
Typically 10-50x faster than pure R implementation for large datasets.
