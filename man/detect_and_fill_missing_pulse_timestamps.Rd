\title{Detect and Fill Missing Pulse Timestamps in Raw Measurement Data}
\usage{
detect_and_fill_missing_pulse_timestamps(
  measurements,
  expected_interval_hours = NULL,
  max_gap_to_fill_hours = 24,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{measurements}{Data frame with datetime and pulse_id columns}

\item{expected_interval_hours}{Expected interval between pulses (hours). If NULL, auto-detected.}

\item{max_gap_to_fill_hours}{Maximum gap size (hours) to fill with interpolated timestamps. Default: 24 hours.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print progress messages}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{measurements_complete}{Data frame with added rows for missing pulses (pulse_id = NA)}
\item{gap_report}{Data frame of detected gaps with columns: gap_start, gap_end, n_missing, duration_hours, filled}
\item{summary}{List with n_actual, n_missing, n_filled, n_expected}
}
\description{
Detects gaps in the time series of raw heat pulse measurements and adds rows
with interpolated timestamps for missing pulses. This runs during data import
to ensure completeness calculations are accurate.
}
\details{
Works at the PULSE level (using pulse_id) rather than individual measurement timestamps,
since each pulse typically has multiple temperature measurements at different time points.
