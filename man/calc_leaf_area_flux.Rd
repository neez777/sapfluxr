\title{Calculate leaf-area-specific sap flux}
\usage{
calc_leaf_area_flux(Qp, Al, Al_units = "m2")
}
\arguments{
\item{Qp}{Numeric vector. Total tree sap flux in cm³/hr (from calc_sap_flux()).}

\item{Al}{Numeric. Total plant leaf area in m² (or cm²). Should be a single
value or a vector matching the length of Qp.}

\item{Al_units}{Character. Units of leaf area: "m2" (default) or "cm2".}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of leaf-area-specific sap flux (Qpl) in cm³/hr/m²
(if Al_units = "m2") or cm³/hr/cm² (if Al_units = "cm2").
}
\description{
Calculates sap flux per unit of supported leaf area (Qpl) by dividing total
tree sap flux (Qp) by total plant leaf area (Al). This metric relates water
uptake to transpiring leaf area and is useful for ecophysiological studies.
}
\details{
The formula is:
Qpl = Qp / Al

Where:
\itemize{
\item Qp = total tree sap flux (cm³/hr)
\item Al = total plant leaf area (m² or cm²)
\item Qpl = leaf-area-specific flux (cm³/hr/m² or cm³/hr/cm²)
}

Leaf-area-specific flux is conceptually similar to transpiration rate and
can be compared to stomatal conductance measurements. It accounts for
differences in tree size through leaf area rather than sapwood area.

Note: Leaf area measurements are challenging and often estimated from
allometric relationships. Measurement methods include:
\itemize{
\item Direct harvest and scanning
\item Allometric equations (from DBH, height, etc.)
\item Leaf area index (LAI) measurements scaled to individual trees
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After calculating sap flux
flux_results <- calc_sap_flux(flux_data, sapwood_areas)

# Calculate leaf-area-specific flux
Qpl <- calc_leaf_area_flux(
  Qp = flux_results$Q_cm3_hr,
  Al = 12.5,  # m²
  Al_units = "m2"
)
}
