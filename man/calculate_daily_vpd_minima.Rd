\title{Calculate Daily Minimum VPD}
\usage{
calculate_daily_vpd_minima(weather_data, vpd_col = "vpd_kpa")
}
\arguments{
\item{weather_data}{Data frame containing weather data with columns:
\code{datetime} and \code{vpd_kpa} (typically from \code{\link{calc_vpd}})}

\item{vpd_col}{Name of VPD column (default: "vpd_kpa")}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\item{date}{Date (as Date class)}
\item{min_vpd}{Minimum VPD for that day (kPa)}
\item{mean_vpd}{Mean VPD for that day (kPa)}
\item{max_vpd}{Maximum VPD for that day (kPa)}
\item{sd_vpd}{Standard deviation of VPD for that day (kPa)}
\item{n_obs}{Number of observations that day}
}
\description{
Extracts daily minimum VPD values from weather data, used to identify
days with low atmospheric demand suitable for spacing correction.
}
\details{
\strong{Why Daily Minimum VPD?}

Daily minimum VPD values are used because:
\itemize{
\item They occur during periods of lowest atmospheric demand (typically pre-dawn)
\item Low VPD indicates high humidity and minimal transpiration stress
\item Stable low VPD suggests consistent environmental conditions
\item Sap flow during low VPD is less influenced by environmental drivers
}

\strong{For Spacing Correction:}

Low VPD periods are ideal for spacing correction because:
\itemize{
\item Minimal transpiration = low sap flow rates
\item Stable conditions = consistent probe thermal environment
\item Reduced environmental noise in baseline measurements
\item Better detection of probe spacing effects vs. environmental effects
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Import and process weather data
weather <- read_weather_data("weather_station.csv")
weather_vpd <- calc_vpd(weather)

# Calculate daily minimum VPD
daily_vpd <- calculate_daily_vpd_minima(weather_vpd)

# View days with lowest VPD
head(daily_vpd[order(daily_vpd$min_vpd), ])
}
